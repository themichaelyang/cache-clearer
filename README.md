Cache clearer chrome extension, no frills attached.
Click to toggle on/off for current tab.

Use it when developing, use it when browsing. Go wild.

# A short story

I had a cache clearer extension from the Chrome Web Store once; it ended up getting removed due to malware.

Use this one instead; its open source so you view the source and can load it unpacked.

Unlike other cache clearers, it can toggle clearing independently per tab, so you don't have to keep turning it on and off. Plus it's MIT licensed.

Inspired by [this](https://github.com/uoziod/chrome-cache-killer), which is the extension I used to use before it went bad.

# Installation

Git clone or download `cache-clearer`. Go to `chrome://extensions`, and enable developer mode. Then "LOAD UNPACKED" and select the `cache-clearer` directory.

See [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) for more details.
